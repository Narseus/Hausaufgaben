import pandas as pd

//Using "pandas" library is much easier for reading "CSV" files

    df = pd.read_csv(r"E:\Book10.csv")
    list1 = df.values.tolist()

//I didn't know how to directly print my CSV file recrusievly, so i converted it to a list

def fun():
    list2 = List1[0]
  return [list2,df]

//At last we call this a recrusive function because it returns something in it's "Define Function" ; in this case it returns list2 which is defiend to just return the first column
//You can use my BRAINY code by simply entring path of your CSV file in line 5
//A screenshot of my own result is available
