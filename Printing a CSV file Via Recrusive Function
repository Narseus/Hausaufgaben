_//Using "pandas" library is much easier for reading "CSV" _files_

    df = pd.read_csv(r"E:\Book10.csv")

//I didn't know how to directly print my CSV file recrusievly, so i converted it to a list

def fun():
    list1 = [df]
  return [list1,df]

//At last we call this a recrusive function because it returns something in it's "Define Function" in this case it reverse the result
//You can use my BRAINY code by simply entring path of your CSV file in line 5
//A screenshot of my own result is available
